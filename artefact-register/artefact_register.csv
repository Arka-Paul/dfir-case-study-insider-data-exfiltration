Artefact_ID,Artefact_Type,Phase,Category,What_It_Demonstrates,Evidential_Notes
1,Deleted instructional document,Reconnaissance,Preparation,Research into encryption and data concealment techniques prior to data extraction,Recovered from deleted space; supports preparatory intent but does not confirm execution
2,Web research artefact,Reconnaissance,Preparation,Interest in anonymisation services and financial obfuscation concepts,Indicates research activity; content alone does not prove subsequent misuse
3,Encrypted container file,Record,Data Exfiltration,Secure storage of extracted sensitive data using encryption,Encryption prevents direct content review; indicates intent to protect data
4,File system metadata,Record,Data Handling,Creation and modification of files associated with data aggregation,Metadata supports staging activity but not data origin
5,Archive file,Record,Data Exfiltration,Compression and aggregation of multiple files prior to storage or transfer,Supports preparation for exfiltration; contents partially inaccessible
6,Encoded text file,Aftermath,Credential Concealment,Deliberate hiding of access credentials using encoding techniques,Decoded via forensic tooling; supports concealment but not user identity
7,Steganographic image,Aftermath,Anti-Forensics,Hidden data embedded within image media,Recovered through forensic analysis; indicates deliberate obfuscation
8,Image metadata artefact,Aftermath,Anti-Forensics,Manipulation of file headers and extensions to mask true content,Supports concealment techniques; requires corroboration
9,Deleted file remnants,Aftermath,Anti-Forensics,Attempted removal of artefacts following data handling activity,Recovered from unallocated space; deletion timing approximate
10,Registry MRU entry,Aftermath,User Interaction,User interaction with files relevant to the incident,Confirms access activity; cannot distinguish between shared users
11,LNK shortcut file,Aftermath,User Interaction,Execution or opening of key files linked to the investigation,Supports file access; shortcut creation time may differ from execution
12,Shellbag registry artefact,Aftermath,User Interaction,Navigation to directories associated with sensitive files,Supports directory access; not proof of file manipulation
13,Thumbcache artefact,Aftermath,User Interaction,Preview generation of files linked to the investigation,Supports file visibility; does not prove content access
14,Application execution artefact,Record,Execution Activity,Use of tools consistent with encryption or data handling behaviour,Supports tool usage; does not confirm purpose
15,Log file artefact,Record,Execution Activity,Timestamped activity aligning with data handling events,Log completeness dependent on system configuration
16,Hidden attribute file,Aftermath,Anti-Forensics,Use of OS-level hiding techniques to obscure artefacts,Supports concealment intent; files remain recoverable
17,Temporary file remnants,Record,Data Handling,Intermediate file creation during processing of sensitive data,Supports active data manipulation; limited contextual detail
18,Credential fragment artefact,Aftermath,Credential Handling,Partial reconstruction of multi-part access credentials,Supports access capability; full credential not published
19,Configuration artefact,Reconnaissance,Preparation,System configuration adjusted to support subsequent activity,Change timing supports preparation phase
20,Timeline correlation artefact,Aftermath,Correlation,Alignment of multiple artefacts into a coherent incident timeline,Supports sequencing; dependent on system clock accuracy
21,Partial wipe indicator,Aftermath,Anti-Forensics,Indications of attempted clean-up or trace removal activity,Supports anti-forensic intent; effectiveness limited
22,Shared account usage artefact,Aftermath,Attribution Limitation,Activity performed under shared credentials,Prevents definitive attribution to a single individual
